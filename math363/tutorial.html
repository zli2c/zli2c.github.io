<p>
1.Would you like to have a "tutorial" session (where solutions to the
	assignment are explained and/or more examples of material covered in
	class is given) instead of office hours
	for the last two weeks?<br>
    <INPUT type="radio" name="tutorial" value="yes"> Yes<BR>
    <INPUT type="radio" name="tutorial" value="yes2"> Yes, but only
    April 14, not April 7.<BR>

2.If you would like to come to the tutorial, are you able to attend
(Wednesday 2:30pm-4 pm)?<br>

<h3>Extra topics</h3>
In the last few classes, we will see some results from other areas of discrete
mathematics (all non-examinable). Which of the following would most
interest you (see the table at the bottom of this page for a brief description)?

<table border=1 align="center">
<tr>
<td>Combinatorial game theory</td><td align="left">Nim is a 2 player
	game. At the start of the game, there are 3 piles of
	tokens. Players take turn choosing one pile and removing a positive
	number of tokens from the chosen pile. The player to taken the last
	token wins.<br><br>
	In a variant of this game, there is only one pile of tokens but
	players must remove either 1, 7 or 10 tokens from the pile when it
	is their turn<br><br>
	We look at how to win at these and other turn based full information
	games.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Four colour theorem</td><td>The four colour theorem is a famous
	problem in graph theory. The theorem states that the regions of any
	map can be coloured with four colours so that regions sharing a
	border receives different colours<br><br>
	Although the theorem is simple to state. Its proof is surprisingly
	difficult. An interesting, but less well know, fact about this proof
	is that it is computer assisted. That is at some points in the
	proof, a computer is used to check hundreds of cases.<br><br>
	We look at the proof on a high level and see just how a computer is
	used.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Counting labelled trees</td><td> Determining the number of
	(unlabelled) graphs with <i>n</i> vertices
	is difficult. However, determining the number of labelled graphs is
	easy. Suppose instead we want to determine the number of labelled
	trees. It turns out that there is a very nice bijection for
	counting labelled tree. This is know as the Prüfer sequence.<br><br>
	We look at the simple algorithm which turns a tree into a number
	and back.</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Combinatorial design</td><td>Suppose we building large complex
	system which has many "switches" which can be individually set to "on"
	or "off". We want to make sure our system does not break but it would
	take too much time to test all combination of switch states. It was
	noticed that if the system breaks, it is due to a combination of a
	small number of switches. We would like to design a series of tests
	(in each test, we set each switch to some state "on" or
	"off").<br><br>
	We use combinatorial designs to show that few tests are needed.
